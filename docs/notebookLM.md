# NotebookLM Guidance: Supply Risk QuantumSim

## Suggested NotebookLM Items
1.  **Risk Profile**: Identifying the "weakest link" in vertically integrated supply chains.
2.  **Quantum Advantage Whitepaper**: Explaining where QAOA heuristics outperform classical Monte Carlo on NP-hard disruption sets.
3.  **Resilience Scorecard**: A template for measuring supply chain 'node physics' health.

## Suggested Prompt
"Based on the Monte Carlo and percolation theory documents, simulate a major supplier failure in the Starship engine production line. How does vertical integration mitigate this shock compared to traditional outsourcing? Explain the quantum advantage in rerouting this supply chain in real-time."

## Infographics

### Standard Infographic Prompt
"Create an infographic on 'Supply Chain Resilience'. Use a network graph to show how disruptions 'percolate' through the links. Highlight the 'Vertical Integration Shield' that Starship uses to reduce risk."

### Detailed Infographic Prompt
"Generate a technical infographic titled 'Quantum Resilience Modeling'. Breakdown the Monte Carlo simulation of supplier delays and the QAOA-style rerouting heuristics. Contrast NP-Hard disruption sets in traditional outsourcing vs vertically integrated systems."

## Gemini Canvas Visual Prompt
"Develop an interactive 'Resilience Node Map'. Show a complex supply chain network. Trigger a 'Supplier Delay' disruption and visualize how the shock percolates through the links as red warning pulses. Then, activate the 'Vertical Integration Shield' and 'Quantum Optimizer' to show the network reconfiguring and the red pulses disappearing as resilience is restored."

## Theme
**The Resilient Node**: Dark obsidian backgrounds with glowing amber (warning) and emerald (resilience) connectivity lines.
