# Research & First Principles: Supply-Risk-QuantumSim

## Core Concept: Percolation and Disruptions
Modeling the catastrophic collapse of supply networks as a percolation phenomenon.

## Key Insights
- Critical thresholds in supply network connectivity.
- Quantum-inspired algorithms for risk assessment across multi-tier networks.
