# Aerospace Supply Chain Resilience with Quantum Simulation

**Type**: Hybrid AI-quantum disruption engine

**Description**: Model disruptions in aerospace chains (supplier delays, part shortages for reusable vehicles) using AI for prediction and quantum-inspired optimization for resilient rerouting or sourcing.

**First Principles**: Networks snap at weakest link. Percolation shows collapse thresholds—build resilience from node physics.

**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo + QAOA-style heuristics to minimize downtime. Tie to Starship's vertical integration reducing risks.

**Context**: Great for showing quantum's edge on NP-hard problems.

## Overview
This repository explores how supply chain disruptions "percolate" through networks, using a combination of fractal geometry and quantum simulation concepts.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore percolation simulations in `notebooks/`.
3. Check [data_links.md](docs/data_links.md) for disruption event datasets.
